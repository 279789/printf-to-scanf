# From `printf` to `scanf`: Reading Input from Streams

## 1) Introduction

In the [previous exercise](https://github.com/STEMgraph/279a01d6-7696-46b7-9cb7-2c44773ad06b), we used `fprintf` to write simple messages to the terminal. Now that we can send data **out**, it's time to learn how to get data **in**.

In C, the most common function for reading input is `scanf`. It reads formatted data from `stdin` — the standard input stream, usually the keyboard.

To really understand what `scanf` does, we’ll take a look at what happens behind the scenes on a lower level. Specifically, we’ll look at how Assembly and system calls perform the same kind of input operation.

```asm
01  section .bss
02      buffer resb 32            ; reserve 32 bytes
03
04  section .text
05      global _start
06
07  _start:
08      mov     rax, 0            ; syscall: read
09      mov     rdi, 0            ; file descriptor 0 = stdin
10      mov     rsi, buffer       ; pointer to memory buffer
11      mov     rdx, 32           ; max number of bytes to read
12      syscall
13
14      ; syscall: exit
15      mov     rax, 60
16      xor     rdi, rdi
17      syscall
```

This program reads up to 32 bytes from standard input and stores them in a buffer.

- Lines 01–02 define a memory area where input can be stored.
- Lines 08–12 prepare and invoke the `read` system call.
- Line 09 uses file descriptor `0`, which corresponds to `stdin`.

---

As you already know, in POSIX systems, three standard streams are available to every process by default:

| File Descriptor | Symbolic Name | Description |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `0`             | `stdin`        | Standard input (keyboard, file, or pipe) |
| `1`             | `stdout`       | Standard output (terminal screen) |
| `2`             | `stderr`       | Standard error output (also terminal) |

These correspond directly to how `printf` and `scanf` interact with the outside world.

Now let’s move from Assembly back to C. Here’s a minimal example that uses `scanf`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char name[32];

    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%31s", name);  // safe bounded input
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);

    return 0;
}
```

This reads a single word (up to 31 characters) from the keyboard and prints it back to the screen.

- `scanf("%31s", name)` ensures that the input won’t overflow the `name` buffer.
- Input is taken from `stdin`, which typically means the keyboard.


## 2) Tasks

1. **Use scanf**: Create a small program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints both.
2. **Explore fgets**: Replace `scanf` with `fgets` and read a full line instead.
3. **Compare to ASM**: Match the C code to the Assembly syscall behavior.


## 3) Questions

1. What does `scanf` do, and from where does it read by default? Scanf does is a nice fuction, that is able to read your input, but it's only able to read words. It reads by deffault from the stdin wich is the keyboard buffer.

2. What are the risks of using `scanf("%s", ...)` without a length specifier? The risk is that you get a overflow of the buffer, because scanf doesn t check if there is enaugh storage in the array

3. How is the `read` system call used in Assembly to receive input from `stdin`? First the system call defines rax 0 wich is the syscall function for read, than it sets the file descriptor rdi 0, wich is used for "stdin" standard in input buffer, thats the point from where the syscall reads. Next we need to set where our string gets saved. This is done by rsi, buffer wich is the address of our first "Buffer Storage Byte". Next the length of bytes that should be read is defined, which in our case is 32: rdx 32. Last command is syscall, which executes the syscall.

4. What is the purpose of file descriptor `0`?File descriptor 0 is the fd for standard input, which is by standard the keyboard buffer, in our case it's the place from where the syscall reads.

## 4) Advice

Don’t stop at writing output — reading and processing input is what gives your programs real interactivity. Practice reading both from the terminal and from files. Always guard against buffer overflows by specifying maximum lengths in `scanf`, and use `fgets` when reading entire lines. Getting comfortable with streams and input handling is an essential skill in systems programming.
